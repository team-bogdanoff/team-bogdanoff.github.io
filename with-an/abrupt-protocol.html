          There exists a specific methodology to induce a Bogpill within an individual, although due 
          to its controversial nature it is only performed by amateurs and as such, the quality might 
          be unreliable or even unsafe. Firstly, the individual is placed either with some kind of 
          ceremonial item, such as a mask or an article of clothing, or alone (but this is highly 
          discouraged). Then, the individuals performing the operation will begin creating a rhythmic 
          beat and chanting an ancient incantation thought to have ties to the Bogs, the words of 
          which loosely translating to "Bogda, Bogda, Bog-da-noff." As this chant progresses and 
          speeds up, the individual will begin to enter phases 1 and 2 of the Bogpill. To further 
          this process and guide the individual through stage 3 without them dropping out, one of 
          the people performing the operation must mentally and physically prepare themselves for 
          the Bogs to channel their energy through them. They will begin performing a rapid dance 
          move directed at the individual who is being Bogpilled. One can normally prevent the 
          harmful events of this dance move by aligning their arms in an x shape across their chest 
          and shouting "Obunga," although an individual in stage 3 will be unable to move and cannot 
          do this. The individual will be in extreme and noticeable pain if the Bogpill procedure is 
          working, and will immediately black out once complete. Upon returning to this plane of 
          reality, they will be highly collected and become immune to both the dance move and the 
          Orange Justice and will progress naturally through stages 4 and 5 of the Bogpill on their 
          own.

        <p role="heading" aria-level="2">Phases of the Bogpill</p>
        <ol class="protocol">
          <li>
            <strong>Zeta Phase:</strong> This is the first phase of the Bogpill and lasts for 20 
            minutes. The only symptom will be a prickly sensation on the skin.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Gamma Phase:</strong> This is the second phase and lasts another 20 minutes. 
            Individual will become hypersensitive to sound and begin to hear Bogs, but they will be 
            unable to understand the Bogspeech. Hearing colors and uncontrollable shaking are also 
            potential symptoms.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Omega Phase:</strong> Individuals will begin to feel extreme pain and become 
            unable to move. Many drop out at this phase due to the strenuous conditions placed upon 
            the human body and mind at this time. This phase can last anywhere between 10 seconds 
            and 15 minutes. In some extreme cases, Igor may appear (but NEVER Grichka).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tartaka (rough translation) Phase:</strong> Individuals will gain a Bogface and 
            will have the ability to see everything, including other universes. Communication with 
            aliens will be opened, and the individual will gain an addiction to Bogposting. At this 
            point, individuals must abandon their friends and family. It is notable that if an 
            individual reaches this phase, the Bogpill operation is considered a success.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>рпцлг Phase:</strong> This is the final documented phase of the Bogpill and can 
            only be reached by advanced individuals. Aliens will become visible to the individual 
            that will challenge their mental capacity, and the individual will become able to fly 
            and solve any question asked of them. In addition, pleasuring one's genitals with citrus 
            will no longer cause pain.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Theorized Sixth Bogstage:</strong> This phase in the Bogpill process has never 
            been reached, but according to simulations run by the world's top scientists, immortality 
            may be granted and the individual within this phase could even replace Igor.  Inside the 
            simulation of the sixth stage, the boundaries between the dimensions grow and begin to 
            resemble the chins and cheeks. This leads to a seventh stage that allows for presentation 
            of visions of Grichka, whose true form is Ğрęчх.
