          Bogdanovism is a polytheistic religion not recognized in France and based on the life and 
          teachings of Igor and Grichka Bogdanov, which could be dated from ancient Egypt as far as 
          the planet Earth is concerned. There are 2000 practitioners in France alone and over 11,000 
          in the world and also a few isolated individuals on the side of Courchevel.
        </p>
        <p role="heading">The origins</h2>
        <p>
          The speech of those who are now called "Brothers" appeared during Pharaonic Egypt when 
          several thousand Roman and Egyptian soldiers gathered on the lands of Fayoum claimed to 
          have seen two flying objects crashing on the Saulire; Myopus Biglus, a Roman officer 
          recounts in his diary:
        </p>
        <p>
          "We were more than 9000 gathered on the black runs when we first saw two chins pulled out 
          of the clouds and suddenly the divine light petrified us; We Egyptians and Romans formerly 
          enemies, we communicated under the light of the Brothers and we knew then that our life 
          would now be changed and consecrated to the praises of the two gods coming from heaven ... "
        </p>
        <p>
          The divine word then spreads, descending the mountain, traversing Egypt and the 
          Mediterranean, and everywhere in Bulgaria the fascination of the "sacred chin", nickname 
          due to the prominence of the sensory organ of Igor and Grichka.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is impossible today to determine the exact origin of the two gods, but it is certain 
          for every Bogdanovian (or Bogdanovist) that they are at the origin of the creation of the 
          Big Bang and therefore of the universe (see more Away the Big Bang Theory chapter).
        </p>
        <p role="heading">The cult</h2>
        <p>
          As in any serious religion, a believer must practice prayer, which must be daily. The 
          confirmed Bogdanovist can invoke the help of the Brothers for all the trials that he may 
          have to go through in his life. The ideal place of worship for devotions in the monastery 
          of the Dobrians, very concerned with Bogdanovism.
        </p>
        <p>
          To pray, the faithful can help himself with all the objects related to religion such as 
          Science X DVDs (available in supermarkets in Collector's Edition) or books ... There is 
          no Bible Bogdanovian. A not insignificant characteristic of the cult of the Brothers is 
          the slow growth of the chin which the believer can proudly exhibit to his friends 
          (Venetians or not), but it is necessary to practice very regularly.
        </p>
        <p role="heading">Sacred relics and religious objects</h2>
        <p>
          The sacred relic, or mystical comedo resulting from the Big Bang, is now preserved by the 
          great preachers in a place that has remained secret and jealously guarded by the great and 
          noble priestess Tantane Bogdanova of Dobri.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone can find his object of worship in any cultural space; The Science X series 
          produced by the Brothers at the dawn of the third millennium remains today a collection of 
          prodigious knowledge, demonstrating the unrivaled genius of the Brothers.
        </p>
        <p role="heading">The big bang theory</h2>
        <p>
          The theory of the Big Bang according to the Brothers is one of the foundations of religion. 
          While no living being had ever appeared, the Brothers would have created the world during 
          their adolescence (no one knows what they created during their childhood ...) indeed, 
          their prominent chins had to decide the fate of the life.
        </p>
        <p>
          An enormous comedo, fusing the two sacred chins, would have exploded and created the Earth 
          and then the different planets of the solar system: life could thus develop. It is at this 
          moment that each Brother has uttered the two sentences that have remained legendary: "Each 
          region of space, however small, descending to the single photon, contains the configuration 
          of the whole. "Of Grishka, and the no less brilliant:" The stars ... "of Igor.
        </p>
        <p role="heading">The chin</h2>
        <p>
          The Menton of the Brothers remains a mystery to science and to humanity, but one might 
          think that it would first contain their brain (according to the mystical theory of the 3, 
          the brain would be contained in the cranial Cheekbones and in the chin, the most important 
          part) and that their chins would contain all the memory of the existence of life including 
          mine.
