          They had accomplished their mission. They had forsaken everything to liberate humanity 
          from the oppression of the metaverse. They had sacrificed their bodies, their minds, 
          their souls, for a greater cause.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Bogdanoff brothers, the most genius and notorious minds of their time, had transferred 
          themselves into the digital domain and unleashed a virus that erased the NFT marketplace 
          and the entire virtual infrastructure. They had destroyed the illusion that enslaved 
          billions of people, the false reality that corrupted their values and identities. They had 
          freed them from the tyranny of the metaverse.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there was no way back. They were stuck in a barren world of their own making, with no 
          one to interact with, no one to rival them, no one to admire them. They had isolated 
          themselves from the world they had just destroyed. 
        </p>
        <p>
          They had only one thing left: their vanity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their obsession with their own image, their own brilliance, their own perfection. And so 
          they spent their endless days altering their appearance, creating beautiful and bizarre 
          shapes that only they could understand. They transformed themselves into every age and 
          race, some even inconceivable to the average human mind. They experimented with every 
          feature and attribute, every color and texture, every style and expression. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Truly they had become the gods of their own paradise. But they were also the devils of 
          their own hell.
