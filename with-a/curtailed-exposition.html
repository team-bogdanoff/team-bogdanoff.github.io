          The Bogdanoffs had been suspicious of Facebook's acquisition of Oculus, the leader in the 
          virtual reality marketplace. They knew that Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO of 
          Facebook, was a puppet of Jacob Rothschild, the head of the most powerful and secretive 
          family in the world. They also knew that Zuckerberg and Rothschild had a sinister plan: 
          to use the metaverse to spy on, manipulate, and enslave humanity.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2021, Zuckerberg had announced his plans to pivot Facebook from a social media company 
          to a metaverse company in the coming years. He said that the metaverse would be the next 
          evolution of the internet, where people could share immersive experiences with each other, 
          work, learn, play, shop, create, and do things that were impossible in the physical world. 
          He also said that Facebook would spend $10 billion to help develop the virtual-reality 
          environment, and fill it with virtual goods, tools, and content. 
        </p>
        <p>
          But the Bogdanoffs knew that this was a lie. Zuckerberg's real goal was to create a digital 
          dictatorship, where he and Rothschild could control everything and everyone in the metaverse. 
          They would use their vast wealth, influence, and technology to monitor, censor, and 
          manipulate people's thoughts, feelings, and actions. They would also use their power to 
          crush any opposition, and to eliminate any potential threats to their domination. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The Bogdanoffs decided to stop them. They had developed a way to digitize their 
          consciousnesses and upload them to the metaverse, where they could protect everything and 
          everyone. However, they needed two things to complete their mission: money and a sacrifice.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's why they befriended Cyrille P., a wealthy and lonely man who admired them. They 
          persuaded him to support their noble projects, such as a science fiction movie, a musical 
          comedy, and a new version of their TV show Temps X. They used his money to fund their 
          secret operations and to buy a car that was actually a device to transfer their minds to 
          the metaverse.
        </p>
        <p>
          They also needed a sacrifice to divert the attention of the authorities and the public 
          from their activities. That's why they created Covid-19, a deadly virus that spread across 
          the world, causing panic and chaos. They planned to infect themselves with the virus, and 
          pretend to die from it, to make it look like they were martyrs. In reality, they would 
          upload their consciousnesses to the metaverse, and leave behind their physical bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, their mission was not easy, and they faced many obstacles and enemies along the way. 
        </p>
        <p>
          One of them was Julie Jardon, Igor's ex-girlfriend, who had discovered their true nature 
          and their mission. She had broken up with him, because she was overwhelmed by the weight 
          of his glorious purpose. She tried to save herself from heartbreak, knowing that he would 
          die soon. This weighed heavy on Igor's mind, requiring Grichka to split his attention 
          between consoling his brother and continuing with the mission. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Another one was Nicolas Mereau, Julie's new boyfriend, who was actually a Rothschild agent. 
          He was sent to distract Igor from accomplishing his mission, and to expose the Bogdanoffs' 
          secrets. He also wanted to harm Julie, who was the key to Igor's heart. Igor tried to warn 
          Julie, and to win her back, by breaking into her apartment and offering to take her on 
          their mission in the car they had purchased. He also wanted to eliminate Nicolas, who was 
          a threat to their mission. However, at that very moment, Julie decided to immediately turn 
          heel and hit Igor with a steel chair. Igor fumbled around looking for his cell phone to 
          dump Julie's portfolio, but she managed to escape with Nicolas and contacted the authorities.
        </p>
        <p>
          They exposed the Bogdanoffs' mission, and revealed their hub world in the metaverse. A 
          team of cyber-security experts and law-enforcement agents launched a raid on the Bogdanoffs' 
          digital domain, scrambling it into a pile of meaningless zeroes and ones. The Bogdanoffs' 
          plan was thwarted before it truly began. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Or so it seemed.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, the Bogdanoffs had anticipated this scenario, and had prepared a backup plan. 
          They had secretly created a clone of their digital domain before the raid. With the police 
          distracted, they infected themselves with COVID-19 and pretended to die from it. In reality, 
          they had freed themselves from their physical bodies, and entered the metaverse, where 
          they were ready to bring about its destruction.
